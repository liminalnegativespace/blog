There (she) is
<br>
beneath the soft ceiling

Nails too short to tear down 
<br>
scraps of yellow wallpaper

Mask too thin to fend off
<br> 
smoke from the attic aflame

Limbs too weak to hold up 
<br>
an emaciated body upside down

Lips too stiff to scream in 
<br>
the voice of the mother

There (she) is
<br>
amid the solid silence

too sane to dissolve into
<br>
the letters
<br>
left with no escape but
<br>
to squeeze
<br>
in between 
<br>
the lines
