We can count to ten with one hand


Tie a noose, Ten
<br>
Hang a hook, Nine
<br>
Fire a shot, Eight
<br>
Pinch your nose, Seven
<br>
Make the call, Six
<br>
Slap a face, Five


Shhhhhâ€¦.

Three at the table
<br>
Two chopsticks in hand
<br>
Pointed finger
<br>
then clenched fist

Count to 10
<br>
in binary
<br>
starting from Abandon
<br>
through Martyrdom and Menopause
<br>
ending at Zenith

And start over again
